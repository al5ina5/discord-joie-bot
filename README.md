# FAQ

**How can I change the bot's prefix?**

- The prefix is defined in the `.env` file.

**How I can start contributing?**

- Fork the project
- Follow [How-to / Setup](#how-to--setup) to prepare everything you need
- You are ready!

**How I can use local mongodb ???**

- Your local mongodb url will most likely look like this:
  "`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/joie`". Where `27017` is default mongodb port and `joie` is your database name.

**Does this bot moderation feature commands like `!purge`, `!kick`, and `!ban`?**

- It does not. This is not quite a moderation/utility bot.

**How can I host my bot when I'm away from my machine, 24/7?**

- For that, you'll need to run the program on a remote machine. You'll need a VPS of your own. [You can get a VPS for less than \$10/month on https://revolt.host/!](https://revolt.host/)

**Where can I donate?**

- You can support [UNDERFORUMS on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/underforums), send tips to my Bitcoin address (`3HFuhH4enDUKFqokiron6jyMSzPVwNHkTW`), or send me [XLM on Keybase (@youngseebi)](https://keybase.io/youngseebi)!
